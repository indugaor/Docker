The application should print "Hello, Docker!" and do calculations in a menu driven environment when executed.

Building the Image:
Build a Docker image from the Dockerfile.

Running a Container:
Run a container from the image you built.

Interactive Shell / Portal:
Access the application within a running container and show its working.
Start and stop the containers.
